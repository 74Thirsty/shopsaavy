1.2 **“Documentation”** means any and all user guides, technical manuals, README files, and other written or electronic materials provided with the Software.
1.3 **“Personal License”** means a non-transferable license limited to a single natural person for personal, non-commercial use only.
1.4 **“Business License”** means a non-exclusive license to use the Software for the internal business operations of a single legal entity (and its contractors under strict confidentiality), subject to the limitations in this Agreement.
1.5 **“License Fee”** means the payment required to obtain a License, non-refundable unless expressly stated in writing by Licensor.

## 2. Grant of License — Limited, Conditional, Non-Exclusive

2.1 **Personal License.** Subject to full payment and strict compliance with this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use the Software solely for Licensee’s personal, non-commercial purposes on a single device or domain as specified at purchase.
2.2 **Business License.** Subject to full payment and strict compliance with this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-transferable (except as expressly permitted in Section 16), non-sublicensable, revocable license to use the Software solely for Licensee’s internal business operations on the number of domains or instances expressly purchased.
2.3 **Reservation of Rights.** All rights not expressly granted are reserved. Licensor retains all title, ownership, and intellectual property rights in the Software and Documentation.

## 3. Prohibited Uses — Zero Tolerance

Licensee shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall ensure its affiliates, employees, contractors and agents do not:
a) Copy, reproduce, distribute, sell, rent, lease, sublicense (except as explicitly permitted), disclose, or transfer the Software, Documentation, or any part thereof;
b) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, adapt, or create derivative works of the Software (except to the minimum extent required by mandatory law and then only after Licensee has notified Licensor and afforded Licensor an opportunity to provide a compatible, lawful solution);
c) Use the Software to provide services to third parties (hosting, SaaS, managed services) without a separate commercial license from Licensor;
d) Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, proprietary, or proprietary notices or markings;
e) Attempt to defeat or circumvent any technological protection measures, licensing controls, or copy-protection mechanisms;
f) Use the Software in any manner that infringes or misappropriates any third-party rights or violates applicable laws or regulations;
g) Merge the Software into, or bundle with, any open-source licensed code in a way that would require disclosure of the Software’s source code under any open-source license.

## 4. Delivery, Activation, Fees, and Payment

4.1 **Delivery.** Licensor will provide the Software electronically upon receipt of payment and verification of Licensee identity (if applicable).
4.2 **Fees.** License Fees are non-refundable unless otherwise agreed in writing. Failure to pay any amounts when due is material breach and authorizes Licensor to terminate the License and assert all remedies. Fees, billing, and the license scope are as set forth on Licensor’s invoice or order confirmation.
4.3 **Activation & Verification.** The Software may include license activation, phone-home, or verification mechanisms. Licensee agrees Licensor may verify license status and usage data. Tampering with these mechanisms is a material breach.

## 5. Ownership & Title

5.1 Licensor retains all title, ownership and IP rights in and to the Software and Documentation. This Agreement does not transfer any interest in the Software, other than the limited license granted.

## 6. Audit Rights

6.1 Licensor may, upon twenty-four (24) hours’ notice, audit Licensee’s use of the Software to confirm compliance. Audits will be conducted during normal business hours, not unreasonably, and in a manner that minimizes disruption. If an audit reveals non-compliant use, Licensee shall promptly pay applicable additional License Fees, interest, and reimburse Licensor’s audit costs.

## 7. Support, Maintenance, Updates

7.1 Support or updates are not included unless expressly purchased. Licensor may offer paid maintenance plans. Licensor has no obligation to continue development, fix bugs, or maintain compatibility, except as set forth in a separate written agreement.

## 8. Confidentiality

8.1 Licensee will treat the Software and Documentation as Confidential Information and will not disclose them to any third party except as necessary for permitted internal use and only under written confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Agreement.

## 9. Warranties; Disclaimer

9.1 **Limited Warranty.** For thirty (30) days from delivery, Licensor warrants that the Software will substantially conform to the Documentation. Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty is repair or replacement at Licensor’s option.
9.2 **DISCLAIMER.** EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 9.1, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

## 10. Indemnity

10.1 Licensee shall indemnify and hold Licensor harmless from any claim, liability, loss, damage, cost, or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of Licensee’s breach of this Agreement, misuse of the Software, or violation of law.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

11.1 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE BY THE LICENSEE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

## 12. Remedies; Equitable Relief; Liquidated Damages

12.1 **Injunctive Relief.** Licensee acknowledges that breach of Sections 3, 5, 8, or 13 would cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages are inadequate; Licensor is entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance without posting bond in addition to all other remedies.
12.2 **Liquidated Damages.** Licensee agrees that, in addition to injunctive relief, a material breach of Sections 3 or 8 shall entitle Licensor to liquidated damages in the amount of USD $50,000 per breach (or such greater amount as Licensor can reasonably prove), which the parties agree is a reasonable pre-estimate of anticipated harm and not a penalty, without prejudice to Licensor’s right to recover actual damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.

## 13. Enforcement; Costs; Attorneys’ Fees

13.1 In any enforcement action arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, including appellate fees. Licensee shall also pay all costs of collection.

## 14. Termination

14.1 This Agreement and license shall terminate automatically without notice if Licensee breaches any material provision. Upon termination, Licensee must immediately cease all use of the Software, destroy all copies, certify destruction in writing, and return or destroy any Confidential Information. Licensor may remotely disable the Software where legally permitted.

## 15. Export Controls & Compliance

15.1 Licensee shall comply with all applicable export and import control laws. Licensee shall not export or re-export the Software to countries or persons prohibited by law.

## 16. Transfer, Assignment, and Sublicensing

16.1 Licenses are non-transferable. Assignment or attempted transfer without Licensor’s prior written consent is void and a material breach. Limited exception: Business License may permit assignment to an acquirer of substantially all assets of the Licensee if Licensor is notified and consents (not unreasonably withheld) and the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by this Agreement.

## 17. Severability

17.1 If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in force and the parties shall negotiate in good faith a replacement provision that effects the original intent to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 18. Governing Law & Venue

18.1 This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of [GOVERNING_JURISDICTION], without regard to conflicts of law principles. The parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal and state courts located in [SELECTED VENUE], and waive any objection to inconvenient forum.

## 19. Notices

19.1 Notices must be given in writing to the addresses on the applicable order or invoice. Notices are effective upon receipt.

## 20. Entire Agreement; Amendment

20.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Software and supersedes all prior agreements. No amendment is effective unless in a written instrument signed by both parties.

## 21. Miscellaneous

21.1 **No Implied Licenses.** No license is granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.
21.2 **Publicity.** Licensee shall not use Licensor’s name, trademarks, or logos without prior written permission.
21.3 **Survival.** Sections governing ownership, confidentiality, indemnity, limitation of liability, remedies, and any other provisions that by their nature should survive will do so after termination.

## 22. Signature

By accepting delivery and/or using the Software, Licensee acknowledges having read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this Agreement.

### Quick implementation notes (optional)

* Insert concrete License Fee amounts and the exact governing jurisdiction/venue where indicated.
* Decide whether you want to require license activation (server-side verification) — if yes, include machine activation and tamper penalties explicitly in Section 4 and Section 12.
* Consider specifying precise instance/domain limits in the Business License clause (e.g., “up to X domain names/instances”) and adding per-instance overage fees.

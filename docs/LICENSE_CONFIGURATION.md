# License Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to activate Shop Saavy with your commercial license key, manage offline validation, and troubleshoot
common setup issues.

## 1. Obtain Your License Key

1. Sign in to the Shop Saavy licensing portal using the account that purchased the software.
2. Locate the license assigned to your environment and copy the 25-character key.
3. If you cannot access the portal, contact your account representative or support to have the key re-issued.

## 2. Provide the License to the Application

The runtime checks for a license key in multiple secure locations. Supply the key using whichever option best fits your
infrastructure:

| Priority | Source | Instructions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable | Add `LICENSE_KEY=YOUR-LICENSE-KEY` to `.env` for local development or provision it through your host's secret manager. |
| 2 | System keyring | Store the key with service `shopsaavy` and account `license_key`. The Python `keyring` backend must be available on the host. |
| 3 | License file | Save the raw key to `~/.license_key` or `~/.config/shopsaavy/license_key`. Ensure file permissions restrict access to the service user. |

You can change the key at any time. Restart the application after rotating keys so the new value is loaded into memory.

## 3. Validate the License

Before launching the full stack, validate that the key is accepted by the licensing service:

```bash
python -m src.core.license_cli validate
```

The command prints a JSON payload. A successful response includes `{"valid": true, ...}`. If validation fails, the output
contains `"error"` and an explanatory message. Resolve the issue, update your key, and run the command again until it succeeds.

To check the most recent validation result without pinging the server, run:

```bash
python -m src.core.license_cli status
```

## 4. Offline and Caching Behaviour

- Successful validations are cached for 24 hours in `~/.app_cache/license.json`. The same payload is mirrored to
  `~/.app_cache/license.key` so the application can validate while offline.
- Override these paths with `LICENSE_CACHE_PATH` and `LICENSE_LOCAL_KEY_PATH` if you prefer a custom directory. Ensure the
  process user has read/write access.
- The cached file includes an expiry timestamp. If the timestamp has passed or the cache is older than 24 hours, the
  application will re-contact the license server.

## 5. Logging

License operations are recorded in `/logs/license.log` by default. Set `LICENSE_LOG_PATH` to move the log file to another
location. Review this log whenever the application exits with `[LICENSE ERROR]`â€”it contains the precise validation stage and an
obfuscated view of the key used.

## 6. Troubleshooting Checklist

| Symptom | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `No license key provided.` | Confirm the key is present in one of the supported storage locations and restart the app. |
| `Invalid license.` | Double-check that the key matches the value issued in the portal. Typos and expired keys trigger this response. |
| `License expired.` | Renew your license or contact support to extend the expiry date. |
| `Offline validation unavailable.` | Connect to the internet at least once to perform a successful validation so the cache file can be written. |
| No log file created | Ensure the directory containing `LICENSE_LOG_PATH` exists and is writable by the process user. |

With a valid license in place, you can start Shop Saavy using the normal `npm run dev` or production startup commands.
